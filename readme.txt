This repository contains all the code examples from the book "The Seasoned
Schemer." "The Seasoned Schemer" is a continuation of "The Little Schemer"
(http://bit.ly/4GjWdP) book. It's written in the same style as "The Little
Schemer", i.e., as a dialogue between you and the authors of the book, but the
goal is different - it teaches you to think about the nature of computation.

If you're interested, get the book from Amazon: http://bit.ly/8cyjgw

The code examples were copied (and completed where necessary) from
"The Seasoned Schemer" by Peteris Krumins (peter@catonmat.net).

His blog is at http://www.catonmat.net  --  good coders code, great reuse.
